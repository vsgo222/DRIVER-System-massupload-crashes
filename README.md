Low- and middle- income countries typically lack adequate systems for collecting road crash data. 80% of road crash deaths are missing from official low-income country statistics. This limits their capacity to monitor, effectively advocate for, manage and efficiently improve road safety. 

While many cities, states, and countries have adopted or developed proprietary systems for recording crash data, they are often developed in isolation, limiting the ability to share data among users. These systems may also be expensiveâ€”and unable to support road safety delivery and advocacy. They usually lack a seamless, global, real time, and georeferenced crash repository: a basis for monitoring the scale of the challenge. 

Answering this challenge and offering effective road safety support solutions, the Data for Road Incident Visualization Evaluation and Reporting (DRIVER) open-source system has been developed by the World Bank and GRSF. 

The files here were developed to pilot and operationalize Mumbai instance.
